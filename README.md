This is a Simple Exemple of how **Internationalization** Can be Implemented to a Desktop Program Created With [Microsoft's](https://github.com/microsoft) [WinForms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) Using the [DotNet 6.0 LTS](https://github.com/dotnet) and the [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) Programming Language.

Made as a Learning Exercise to seek a viable and practical solution to apply **multilingual support** to an application.

![Spanish](https://github.com/Marcello-Goncalves/InterForm/blob/master/OutputImages/Spanish.jpg "Spanish")
![English](https://github.com/Marcello-Goncalves/InterForm/blob/master/OutputImages/English.jpg "English")
